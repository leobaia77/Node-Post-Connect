Add a rule-based safety alert system to the backend. This runs WITHOUT the LLM - pure logic.

CREATE NEW FILE: services/safetyRules.ts

SAFETY RULES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. Sleep Deficit Detection:
   - Trigger: 3+ consecutive nights below minimum sleep target
   - Severity: Warning
   - Message: "Sleep has been below [X] hours for [N] nights. Adequate sleep (8-10 hours) is essential for teen development and recovery."
   - Parent alert: Yes

2. Sudden Training Spike:
   - Trigger: Weekly training minutes > 150% of 4-week average
   - Severity: Warning
   - Message: "Training volume increased significantly this week. Consider gradual progression to reduce injury risk."
   - Parent alert: Yes

3. Pain Flag Alert:
   - Trigger: has_pain_flag = true on daily checkin
   - Severity: Info (single), Warning (3+ in 7 days)
   - Message: "Pain has been reported [N] times recently. If pain persists, consider consulting a healthcare provider."
   - Parent alert: Yes if recurring

4. Very Low Energy Pattern:
   - Trigger: energy_level ≤ 2 for 3+ days in a row
   - Severity: Warning
   - Message: "Energy levels have been low. This could indicate inadequate recovery, nutrition, or sleep."
   - Parent alert: Yes

5. High Stress Pattern:
   - Trigger: stress_level ≥ 4 for 5+ days in 7-day window
   - Severity: Info
   - Message: "Stress has been elevated recently. Consider recovery activities and ensure adequate rest."
   - Parent alert: No (privacy)

6. Signs of Restrictive Eating (CRITICAL):
   - Trigger: Combination of:
     * Very low calorie intake logged (< 1200 for multiple days) AND
     * High training volume AND
     * Weight loss goal attempted (if we track this)
   - Severity: Critical
   - Message: "Eating patterns and training may need attention. Adequate nutrition is essential for teen health and development. Consider speaking with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian."
   - Parent alert: Yes
   - Additional: Include resource link for eating disorder support

7. Overtraining Indicators:
   - Trigger: Combination of:
     * High training load (>150% normal) AND
     * Low energy (≤ 2) AND
     * High soreness (≥ 4)
   - Severity: Warning
   - Message: "Signs suggest possible overtraining. Consider a recovery day or reduced intensity."
   - Parent alert: Yes

CREATE: services/safetyChecker.ts
- Function: runSafetyChecks(teenProfileId: string, date: Date)
- Queries recent data for each rule
- Creates safety_alerts records when triggered
- Avoids duplicate alerts (check if similar alert exists in last 24h)
- Returns array of new alerts created

CREATE: Background job (cron or scheduled function)
- Runs daily at configurable time (default 8am teen's timezone)
- Calls runSafetyChecks for all active teen profiles
- Sends push notifications for new alerts

API ENDPOINTS:
- GET /safety-alerts - list alerts for current user
- PUT /safety-alerts/:id/acknowledge - mark as acknowledged
- GET /parent/alerts - parent sees alerts based on sharing settings

IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES (add as code comments):
- Never use shame-based language
- Always frame as supportive, not punitive
- Include "consult a professional" messaging for health concerns
- The app provides guidance, not medical diagnosis
- Respect teen privacy for certain alerts (stress, mood)
