DESIGN NOTES:
- Parent interface should feel supportive, not surveillance-like
- Language should be collaborative: "Support your teen's goals"
- Emphasize that detailed data is only shown with teen consent
- Include educational tooltips explaining what metrics mean
- Non-judgmental framing: "Areas to discuss" not "Problems"
