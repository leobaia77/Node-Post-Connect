Add Apple HealthKit integration to the React Native Expo app.

IMPORTANT: This requires Expo development build, NOT Expo Go.

SETUP:
1. Install expo-health-connect (or react-native-health if needed)
2. Configure app.json for HealthKit entitlement
3. Add usage description strings for privacy prompts

APP.JSON additions:
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSHealthShareUsageDescription": "This app reads your health data to provide personalized sleep, activity, and nutrition recommendations.",
        "NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription": "This app does not write health data."
      },
      "entitlements": {
        "com.apple.developer.healthkit": true,
        "com.apple.developer.healthkit.access": ["health-records"]
      }
    }
  }
}

CREATE: services/healthKit.ts

DATA TYPES TO READ:
- Sleep Analysis (HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis)
- Workouts (HKWorkoutType)
- Steps (HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount)
- Active Energy (HKQuantityTypeIdentifierActiveEnergyBurned)
- Heart Rate (HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate) - optional
- Dietary Energy (HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietaryEnergyConsumed)
- Dietary Protein (HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietaryProtein)
- Dietary Carbohydrates (HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietaryCarbohydrates)
- Dietary Fat (HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietaryFatTotal)

FUNCTIONS TO CREATE:

requestHealthKitPermissions(): Promise<boolean>
- Request read-only permissions for all data types
- Return true if granted, false if denied
- Show educational prompt before system prompt

getSleepData(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): Promise<SleepEntry[]>
- Query sleep analysis samples
- Parse into structured entries with bedtime, wake time, total hours
- Handle "in bed" vs "asleep" categories

getWorkoutData(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): Promise<WorkoutEntry[]>
- Query workout samples
- Map HKWorkoutActivityType to our workout_type enum
- Include duration, energy burned, heart rate summary if available

getStepsAndActivity(date: Date): Promise<ActivitySummary>
- Steps, active energy, move minutes

getNutritionData(date: Date): Promise<NutritionSummary>
- Aggregate daily totals for calories, protein, carbs, fat
- Note: May be incomplete if user doesn't use a food logger that syncs

CREATE: hooks/useHealthKitSync.ts
- Hook that syncs HealthKit data to backend
- Runs on app foreground event
- Shows sync status indicator
- Handles permission denied state gracefully

UPDATE: connect-health.tsx (onboarding screen)
- Explain what data will be read and why
- List specific permissions being requested
- "Privacy: Your health data is encrypted and never used for advertising"
- Show permission request flow
- Handle denial with alternative manual entry option

UPDATE: settings/connections.tsx
- Show HealthKit connection status
- Last sync time
- "Resync Now" button
- "Manage in Settings" button (opens iOS Settings)
- Data quality hints:
  - "✓ Sleep data found"
  - "⚠ Nutrition data not found - connect a food logger"

BACKEND SYNC ENDPOINT:
POST /health-sync
Body: {
  sleep: SleepEntry[],
  workouts: WorkoutEntry[],
  activity: ActivitySummary,
  nutrition: NutritionSummary
}
- Upserts data to respective tables
- Marks source as 'apple_health'
- Returns sync summary

CRITICAL APPLE COMPLIANCE (add as comments in code):
- Never use HealthKit data for advertising or marketing
- Never share HealthKit data with third parties for marketing
- Store only on device or in encrypted backend, never in iCloud
- Provide clear data deletion mechanism
